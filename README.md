### Datasets

We use the **MovieLens Latest Small Dataset** (`ml-latest-small`), which includes:
- **movies.csv**: Metadata about movies (`movieId`, `title`, `genres`).
- **ratings.csv**: User ratings for movies (`userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, `timestamp`).

Download the dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

|                                    | - Effective for cold-start items.                                                                                | - Effective for users with sufficient interaction history.                                                              | - Recommends similar items effectively (e.g., "items like this one").                                                   | - Handles both explicit and implicit feedback well.                                                                     | - Works well with implicit feedback and large datasets.                                                                 |
| **Weaknesses**                     | - Struggles with user cold-start (new users).                                                                    | - Struggles with item cold-start (new items).                                                                            | - Struggles with cold-start items.                                                                                       | - Assumes linear relationships.                                                                                        | - Requires more computational resources and training time.                                                              |
|                                    | - Overfits to user preferences, limiting diversity.                                                              | - Requires sufficient overlapping users for reliable similarity computation.                                            | - Limited diversity (tends to recommend items too similar to previously rated ones).                                     | - Sensitive to hyperparameters like the number of latent factors.                                                      | - Less interpretable compared to simpler methods.                                                                       |
| **Scalability**                    | Scales well with metadata size; limited by the number of items.                                                  | Struggles with large numbers of users (requires pairwise similarity computation).                                        | Scales better than user-based due to item-centric similarity computation.                                                | Scales well for dense matrices; requires decomposition.                                                                 | Scales well with modern hardware (e.g., GPUs); requires significant training data.                                      |
| **Cold-Start Handling**            | - **Strong for items** (uses metadata).                                                                          | - **Weak for items** (relies on collaborative data).                                                                    | - **Weak for items** (relies on collaborative data).                                                                     | - **Weak for both users and items** (needs prior interactions).                                                         | - **Weak for both users and items** (needs prior interactions).                                                         |
| **Interpretability**               | High: Recommendations are based on clear attributes (e.g., genres, tags).                                        | Medium: Based on user-user similarity, but reasoning is less transparent.                                               | Medium: Based on item-item similarity, but reasoning is less transparent.                                               | Medium: Embedding-based but lacks direct interpretability.                                                              | Low: Black-box deep learning model, difficult to explain recommendations.                                               |
| **Implementation Complexity**      | Low: Requires metadata processing and similarity computation.                                                    | Medium: Requires similarity computation and handling sparsity.                                                          | Medium: Requires similarity computation and handling sparsity.                                                          | Medium: Requires matrix decomposition (e.g., SVD).                                                                      | High: Requires neural architecture design, tuning, and large-scale training.                                            |
| **Example Use Case**               | "You liked *The Matrix* because it’s Sci-Fi, so here’s another Sci-Fi movie, *Blade Runner*."                    | "Users like you also enjoyed *The Dark Knight*."                                                                        | "If you liked *Inception*, you might like *Interstellar*."                                                               | "Predict the rating you would give to *The Godfather* based on latent preferences."                                      | "Recommend movies you’re likely to interact with based on learned latent factors and non-linear patterns."              |
| **Performance Metrics**            | Precision, Recall, F1, RMSE (if scoring predictions are used).                                                   | Precision, Recall, F1, NDCG.                                                                                            | Precision, Recall, F1, NDCG.                                                                                            | RMSE, MAE for explicit ratings; Precision, Recall, NDCG for implicit feedback.                                          | Precision, Recall, NDCG, Hit Rate for implicit feedback.                                                                |
| **Flexibility**                    | Flexible with rich metadata; can adapt to new features (e.g., textual descriptions).                             | Limited flexibility; requires user-user overlap for collaborative filtering.                                            | Limited flexibility; requires item-item overlap for collaborative filtering.                                            | Moderate flexibility; primarily focused on numeric ratings.                                                             | Highly flexible; can incorporate side information (e.g., user demographics, item features) into the neural network.     |
